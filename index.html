    <p>My name is Jenny and I am a senior computer science major.</p>
  </div>
  <br>

  <div id="reasons">
    <h2>Reasons For Taking DIG245</h2>
    <p>Almost all the computer science courses I have taken focused on implementing algorithms.
    I want to take a course that allows me to create something that is not only functional,
    but also beautiful.</p>
  </div>
  <br>

  <div id="experience">
    <h2>Programming Experience</h2>
    <p>Here is a list of some computer science courses I have taken.
    However, I have very limited experience with front-end web development.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Data Structures</li>
      <li>Computer Organization</li>
      <li>Analysis of Algorithms</li>
      <li>Software Design</li>
      <li>Database Systems</li>
      <li>Data Visualization</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <br>

  <div id="goals">
    <h2>Goals in DIG245</h2>
    <p>By the end of the semester I would like to be able to design websites independently using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
    I would also be interested in gaining insights into combining front-end web design with back-end database system
    which I learned in another course.</p>

    <h2>Interesting Websites</h2>
    <br>

    <div id="zoomquilt">
      <h3>Zoomquilt</h3>
      <p>The Zoomquilt is essentially an infinitely zooming image. A user may navigate using the up and down arrow keys.
      I find this website artistically appealing and mysteriously illusive.</p>

           alt="Slither.io" width="500" height="300">
      <p><i>Slither.io</i> is a multiplayer browser game where a player controls a snake to grow by eating auto-generated pellets
      or by defeating and consuming other players. This game helps me destress since it is fast-paced and competitive.</p>
      <p>Here is a quote from Wikipedia:</p>
      <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slither.io">
        Soon after release, <i>Slither.io</i> reached the top of the App Store sales charts in the free software category in several
        regions, including the United States and the United Kingdom. By the end of 2016, <i>Slither.io</i> had become Google's most
        searched video game of the year in the United States.

      <p>CodePen is an online learning community for front-end web development where users can experiment and share code
      snippets. This website allows me to discover many creative front-end designs.</p>
      <p>Here is a <a href="https://codepen.io/YutongZ/pen/VNrGMv" target="_blank">link</a> to my own simple design of a box
      that constantly changes color and shape. Note that the <code>followMouse()</code> method implemented in JavaScript
      also allows us to move the box around.</p>
